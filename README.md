# less_fp - Simple less with fixation points.
In principle it's is supposed to help you read a little bit faster.

## Description 
This simple program reads a text file, paginate's and shows it with fixation points in bold. In principal they are supposed to allow you to read faster. <br>
Use **Esc** to quit. <br>
Use '**q**' to prev_page. <br>
Use '**a**' to next_page. <br>
Use '**/**' to search for a string. <br>
Use '**/**' to search + **Enter** key to exit search mode. <br>
Use '**p**' to prev found string. <br>
Use '**n**' to next found string. <br>
Use mouse or keyboard for terminal resize. <br>
I tested it under **Linux** maybe it works under **Windows**. <br>
This is a nostalgia project, so that I could remember the Sintra green terminals that emulated VT100 terminals, in my first years of college :-)
