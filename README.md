# less_fp - Simple less with fixation points.
In principle it's is supposed to help read a little bit faster.

## Description: 
This simple program reads a text file, paginate it and shows it with fixation points in bold. In principal they are supposed to allow you to read faster. <br>
Use Esc to quit. <br>
Use 'q' to prev_page. <br>
Use 'a' to next_page. <br>
Use mouse or keyboard for terminal resize. <br>
I tested it under Linux. <br>
